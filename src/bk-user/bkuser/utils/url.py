def urljoin(host: str, path: str) -> str:
    """
    拼接host, path生成url，核心是处理host, path有多余/的情况
    Q: 为什么不直接使用 urllib.parse.urljoin
    A: urllib.parse.urljoin 会根据path是否带"/"前缀，对host的带部分path进行移除
       urllib.parse.urljoin("https://example.com/abc", "/efg/index.html") => "https://example.com/efg/index.html"
    """
    return "{}/{}".format(host.rstrip("/"), path.lstrip("/"))
